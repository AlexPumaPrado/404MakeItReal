## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I applied what I learned in HTML and CSS of the program, implementing them in an effective way and using flexbox for a more dynamic and personalized design.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<img src="scarecrow.png">
```
```css
@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .container1 {
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 10px 80px;
  }
```



### Continued development

For future projects, I will focus on image optimization to ensure fast loading times. I'll also explore more about implementing CSS to improve the user experience.
